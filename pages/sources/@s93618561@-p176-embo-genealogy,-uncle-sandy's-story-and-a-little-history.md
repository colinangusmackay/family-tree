_Redacted because this source is referenced by a (potentially) living person and may contain personally identifiable information._

## Notes

> Jessie Mackay cross-referenced as "F1.4.8.1" is incorrect. Looking up that reference is Margaret Mackay. None of the other siblings match.

> The singular entry of "Jessie", appearing as a child of Johan X (Fr1.9.4) & William Slater, and sibling to Thomas (Fr1.9.4.1) is presumably reference Id Fr1.9.4.2
