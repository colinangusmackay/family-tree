> Monochrome photograph of cousins Hugh Alexander Ross, Belle Cumming (front left) Nan Ross (Seated) and Alexina Cumming (Right). The photograph was taken in Glasgow on the 24 April 1916. The Rosses lived at Springwell Cottage, Embo and the Cummings at 9 Front Street, Embo. Hugh Alexander was in the Army and the three ladies were tram car drivers in Glasgow. All emigrated to the USA after WW1 with most of their many other siblings and lived the rest of their lives there.

> Small world. My grandfather George Cumming, also from Embo and son of Adam Cumming, emigrated to Boston along with six of his seven siblings just prior to WW I. They mostly settled in Dorchester and Roxbury, but spread out in later years to the Cape, Nahant, Arlington, and so on. My father always told me that there were really only four family names in Embo - Cumming, Ross, McKay and Fraser. Therefore, if I ever ran across someone whose family was from Sutherland with one of those names, I would probably be related.

Just wanted to drop a note in case you are interested. - Many thanks for your comment. We are always interested to hear people's family stories and connections to the local area- Administrator.
