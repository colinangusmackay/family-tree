## Notes

### Note #1

> Employement of James Hanton looks like it reads "Balcock & Wilcox" but this may be a transcription error as the international company Babcock and Wilcox did have a site nearby (opened in 1895 and 2.66km from Albion Street) and there was a railway line that ran from Paisley Hamilton Street to the Babcox works: [https://www.railscot.co.uk/companies/P/Paisley_and_Renfrew_Railway/](https://www.railscot.co.uk/companies/P/Paisley_and_Renfrew_Railway/)
>


### Note #2

> Hank Winder: A hank is a device to assist winding yarn.
