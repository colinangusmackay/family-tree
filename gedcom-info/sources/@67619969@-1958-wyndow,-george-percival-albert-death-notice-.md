## Text

_Redacted because this source is referenced by a (potentially) living person and may contain personally identifiable information._

## Notes

> "Married out of community of property" means they married under a contract (usually an ante-nuptial contract, ANC) that kept their estates separate. Each spouse retained control over their own assets and debts. This terminology is common in South African and Rhodesian legal systems, which were based on Roman-Dutch law.
