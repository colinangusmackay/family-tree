## Notes

> In the sculptor's receipt of instruction letter, they acknowledge the instruction from 20th ult., however the quote wasn't written until the 21st. I expect this to be a typo and it meant to say "30th ult." as this would fit the time frame better.

> "ult." is abbreviated from the latin "ultimo", meaning *of the previous month*.
