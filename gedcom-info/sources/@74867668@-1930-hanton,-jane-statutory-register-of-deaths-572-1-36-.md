> The Fresh Air Home: **The former Peesweep Sanatorium, Glenifer Braes** built in 1910 for the treatment of Tuberculosis, at that time lots of fresh air was thought to help patients. The patients rooms were on the right and during the day the beds would have been wheeled out on to the veranda to get lots of clean air.
