> The date of birth is different on various documents.
>
> <br/>
>
> Decided that 11/Nov/1891 is the correct date for the following reasons:
>
> * In close proximity to dates given there were only two people named Donald Cumming born in Sutherland (1891 and 1892)
>
> * The Donald Cumming born in 1891 in Embo (Fishertown, Dornoch), had a father also called Donald Cumming who was a fisherman (as reference i the Marriage Extract) - The other Donald Cumming had a father called William who was a blacksmith, and was not born in Embo (Fishertown, Dornoch)
>
> * The date of the Birth Extract is only one digit out on the month and year from the Naturalisation documents, so could easily have been a misunderstanding somewhere.
