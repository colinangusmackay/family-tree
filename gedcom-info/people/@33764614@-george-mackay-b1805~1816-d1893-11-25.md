> Rona Grigg's book suggest birth about 1816, but letter from John MacLennan notes that George Mackay was 87 when he died in 1893, putting the date of birth:
>
> Between 26 NOV 1805 and 25 Nov 1806. However, the same letter contradicts itself in the next paragraph by noting that George Mackay was 40 on the birth of his daughter in 1855, which puts his DoB as being between 6 Nov 1814 and 5 Nov 1815.

> The chart in EMBO has a precise date, but it does not appear to be corroborated with the register (as noted by the "(c)" placed next to certain dates). So, accepting the date given by the Registrar in Brora (in the 1984 letter to B.M. Tulloch).
