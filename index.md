## Background

At the start of 2020, I decided to spend more time looking into my family tree. To that end I have been cataloguing details of my family history.

When I initially started I made the classic rookie mistake of taking a scatter gun approach. Unfortunately, this just caused a lot of confusion. I'm now taking hopefully a more directed approach and moving forward from existing edges in my graph.

## The creation of this site

Some of the information on this site is deliberately incomplete. I have not included living persons, however, living people may have been referenced in sources. And I am still collecting genealogical information on living people. 

The rules for deciding if a person has died are:
* There is a death date for the person.
* There is a birth date for the person and that was at least 100 years ago.

In a person's timeline, if a (potentially) living person would have been referenced their name has been replaced with an "X". In some cases it means that the parent of of a person born in the 19th century sometimes appears as "X" because the software has neither a birth or death date, and it assumed they are potentially still alive.

## Can you help?

I am, naturally, looking to fill in the gaps and fix any errors. If you can help, I would very much appreciate it. I am particularly looking for information that connects with what I have already (with accompanying source documents, if possible, so that others who are researching parts of the tree can assess the accuracy and veracity of the information they find here for themselves).

At the bottom of each page there are contact links. You can either [contact me via email at github@colinmackay.scot](mailto:github@colinmackay.scot?subject=Family%20tree%20of%20Colin%20Mackay), or [raise an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/colinangusmackay/family-tree/issues/new?title=Issue%20or%20request%20from%20the%20homepage). The links at the bottom of the page will pre-populate the email subject or GitHub issue with the page you are on. The email link will only work if you have an email client set up for the browser to open.

## The information

Here are some starting points:
* [Index of people by family name](gedcom-info/index-by-family-name.md). Note: this is by birth name.
* [Index of people by date of birth](gedcom-info/index-by-date-of-birth.md).
* [Index of people by Birth location](gedcom-info/index-by-birth-location.md)
* [Index of sources by title](gedcom-info/index-of-sources-by-title.md).

There is also a [blog](blog.md) which contains various information about site changes and various articles and notes I've put together.

All these links can be found at the top of each page too.

## The Geeky Bit

If you are interested in the software side of it. I am using:
* [MobileFamilyTree 9](https://www.syniumsoftware.com/mobilefamilytree) - To store and catalogue the information on my iPad.
* [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) - To move the raw data from MobileFamilyTree to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
* [Stravaig Gedcom](https://github.com/Stravaig-Projects/Gedcom) - My own rendering software (a work in progress) written in C#.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - A Ruby based transformer that generates this site.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - To host this site.
